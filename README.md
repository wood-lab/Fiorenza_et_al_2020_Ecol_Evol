# Fiorenza_et_al_2020_Ecol_Evol
Code associated with Fiorenza et al. 2020, "Fluid preservation causes minimal reduction of parasite detectability in fish specimens: A new approach for reconstructing parasite communities of the past?", Ecology and Evolution.

This code refers to several datasets: one raw dataset on the abundance of various parasite taxa in Walleye Pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus; PollockParasites.csv), one raw dataset on the abundance of various parasite taxa in Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus; EulachonParasites.csv), one raw dataset on the abundance of various parasite taxa in English sole (Parophrys vetulus; EngSoleParasites.csv), and a dataset containing meta-data collected on each host fish individual sampled (HostData.csv).

Data are available in this repository, and are also permanently archived in Dryad:
